## Say Hello to Chassis

This is the demonstration page for my basic theme "chassis" for the CMS [grav](http://getgrav.org/).

Here I collect code and experiences from previous projects, so that I don't have to reinvent things I need again and again for new projects.

Besides all kinds of standard styles, modules and shortcodes, you will also find demonstrations of plugins I have developed.
